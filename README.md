# Hangman

This is an awsome project in python to execute the word guessing game, Hangman. 
We have used a predefined list of words for the guessing, but i feel free to improve this by using a third-party dictionary API.
This project uses loops, functions, and string formatting to print the hangman's progress. It helps you to experiment with bthe standard 
library's randomn, time, and modules.
We have specificallyu used sleep function to introduce pauses to enhance game flow.
